      <p class="Video">
        Muhammad Sajawal dives into making videos for a reason. As we know Scientific Research aims to solve problems and share the findings, the challenge is that there are around 10 million researchers globally, while Social Media has a whopping 4.59 billion users. Understanding this gap, he started creating videos to explain his scientific research and his thoughts more engagingly. By visually presenting the key questions and answers from his research, he hopes to reach a broader audience. These videos act as a bridge, making complex scientific ideas more understandable for everyone. This way, he can go beyond the limitations of traditional research outreach and connect with a diverse group of people, ensuring that the impact of his work reaches far and wide.

        As a passionate forester, he sees it as his main job to tackle the serious problem of climate change, which leads to disasters like floods and a significant loss of biodiversity. Unlike soldiers who deal with clear boundaries and known enemies, fighting climate change is much tougher. In his role as a forester and climate change activist, he faces an invisible enemy. This battle doesn't have specific borders, and its effects are felt worldwide.
